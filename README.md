The replacement repository to take on the task of background removal for images, emulating remove.bg but acting on our own environment.  Below is the current approach, which will be replaced by this functionality.

### Run below command to run remove.bg locally for testing

```bash
chmod +x build-static-cpp.sh

./build-static-cpp.sh
```
